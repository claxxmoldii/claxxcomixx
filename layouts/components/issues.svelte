    <h3>hey there!</h3>
    <p>
      hey there jim! hope everything's okay your side of the globe. must still be cold there, eh. i just recently completed your hugo tutorial from a coupla years back. that was neat. i'll try out a hugo theme/build soon. may i ask you for your ideas about this build... (named it plenti-maxim)

    <h2>some issues...</h2>
    <h4>scrolling</h4>
    <p>
      this scafold has scrolling working okay, (index.html).... until you come back from one of its pages, then it needs reloading for smooth scrolling to work again. is there a way to make the bootstrap id acnchors and the plenti endpoints (routing) work together?
    </p>

    <h4>npm-ing bootstrap/font-awesome/other vendors into plenti</h4>
    <p>
      can you npm packages into plenti and reach it with just imports? i think its cleaner taking that route than calling js scripts near the bottom of the closing body tag. if these things are things that are coming up on plenti, then i just sound like a kid who can't wait for the ice cream truck to come around and i apologize. i'm excited for the cms too!
    </p>

    <h4>is this okay as a plenti theme?</h4>
    <p>
      i'll mix things up a bit, replace images and fonts and details, use different color/mood.  i can attribute original design with a link.
